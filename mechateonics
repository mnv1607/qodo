Mechatronics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and control engineering to design and create intelligent systems, products, and processes. It integrates mechanics and electronics with information technology to build smarter and more adaptable systems. This multidisciplinary approach allows for the development of advanced machines and systems that can operate autonomously, perform complex tasks, and respond to environmental changes.

Key Components of Mechatronics
Mechanical Systems: Deals with the physical framework, structure, and mechanisms that form the basis of the machine or system.
Electronics: Provides the control and power components, including sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers.
Control Systems: Manages the behavior of the system by using algorithms to direct the electronic and mechanical components.
Computer Science and Software Engineering: Enables programming, data processing, and user interface creation, allowing for real-time decision-making and system control.
