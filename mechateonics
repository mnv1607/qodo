Mechatronics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and control engineering to design and create intelligent systems, products, and processes. It integrates mechanics and electronics with information technology to build smarter and more adaptable systems. This multidisciplinary approach allows for the development of advanced machines and systems that can operate autonomously, perform complex tasks, and respond to environmental changes.

Key Components of Mechatronics
Mechanical Systems: Deals with the physical framework, structure, and mechanisms that form the basis of the machine or system.
Electronics: Provides the control and power components, including sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers.
Control Systems: Manages the behavior of the system by using algorithms to direct the electronic and mechanical components.
Computer Science and Software Engineering: Enables programming, data processing, and user interface creation, allowing for real-time decision-making and system control.

Gurgaon (Hindi: [ɡʊɽɡãːw]), officially named Gurugram ([ɡʊɾʊɡɾaːm]), is a satellite city of Delhi and administrative headquarters of Gurgaon district, located in the northern Indian state of Haryana.[7] It is situated near the Delhi–Haryana border, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of the national capital New Delhi and 268 km (167 mi) south of Chandigarh, the state capital.[8] It is one of the major satellite cities of Delhi and is part of the National Capital Region of India.[9] As of 2011, Gurgaon had a population of 876,969.[3][5]

Gurgaon is India's second largest information technology hub and third largest financial and banking hub.[10][11] Gurgaon is also home to one of India's largest medical tourism industries.[12] Despite being India's 56th largest city in terms of population, Gurgaon is the 8th largest city in the country in terms of total wealth.[13] It serves as the headquarters of many of India's largest companies, is home to thousands of startup companies and has local offices for more than 250 Fortune 500 companies.[14] It accounts for almost 70% of the total annual economic investments in Haryana state, which has helped it become a leading hub for high-tech industry in northern India.[15] Gurgaon is categorised as very high on the Human Development Index, with an HDI of 0.889 (2017).[16]
